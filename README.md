## NBA Fantasy League Simulation

In this project, we are using the dataset from *basketball-reference.com* which includes the stats of each individual player from the NBA 2019-2020 season.

I am an avid fan of NBA Basketball and would partake in fantasy leagues with my friends every so often. I wanted to create a fun little visualization tool that showed different lineups and their expected fantasy point total would be for a single game. 

I created a dashboard that allows users to create two hypothetical NBA teams with the standard PG, SG, SF, PF, and C positions and see the estimated fantasy score the lineup would produce. 

Using a filter, users can swap players on either Home or Away team and the predicted score would change accordingly depending on that players stats. Users can use this feature to compare the two opposing teams and their expected outputs. 

I used the standard Yahoo Basketaball Fantasy formula (Point = 1pt, Rebound = 1.2pts, Assist = 1.5pts, Steal = 3pts, Block = 3pts, TO = -1pt) to calculate the point totals which can also easily be changed by editing the Team Score calculated field.
